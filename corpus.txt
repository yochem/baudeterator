Turmoil has engulfed the
Galactic Republic. The taxation
of trade routes to outlying star
systems is in dispute.

Hoping to resolve the matter
with a blockade of deadly
battleships, the greedy Trade
Federation has stopped all
shipping to the small planet
of Naboo.

While the Congress of the
Republic endlessly debates
this alarming chain of events,
the Supreme Chancellor has
secretly dispatched two Jedi
Knights, the guardians of
peace and justice in the
galaxy, to settle the conflict....

------------------II

There is unrest in the Galactic
Senate. Several thousand solar
systems have declared their
intentions to leave the Republic.

This separatist movement,
under the leadership of the
mysterious Count Dooku, has
made it difficult for the limited
number of Jedi Knights to maintain
peace and order in the galaxy.

Senator Amidala, the former
Queen of Naboo, is returning
to the Galactic Senate to vote
on the critical issue of creating
an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC
to assist the overwhelmed
Jedi....

-----------------------III

War! The Republic is crumbling
under attacks by the ruthless
Sith Lord, Count Dooku.
There are heroes on both sides.
Evil is everywhere.

In a stunning move, the
fiendish droid leader, General
Grievous, has swept into the
Republic capital and kidnapped
Chancellor Palpatine, leader of
the Galactic Senate.

As the Separatist Droid Army
attempts to flee the besieged
capital with their valuable
hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a
desperate mission to rescue the
captive Chancellor....

--------------------------IV

It is a period of civil war.
Rebel spaceships, striking
from a hidden base, have won
their first victory against
the evil Galactic Empire.

During the battle, Rebel
spies managed to steal secret
plans to the Empire's
ultimate weapon, the DEATH
STAR, an armored space
station with enough power to
destroy an entire planet.

Pursued by the Empire's
sinister agents, Princess
Leia races home aboard her
starship, custodian of the
stolen plans that can save
her people and restore
freedom to the galaxy.....

---------------------------V


It is a dark time for the
Rebellion. Although the Death
Star has been destroyed,
Imperial troops have driven the
Rebel forces from their hidden
base and pursued them across
the galaxy.

Evading the dreaded Imperial
Starfleet, a group of freedom
fighters led by Luke Skywalker
has established a new secret
base on the remote ice world
of Hoth.

The evil lord Darth Vader,
obsessed with finding young
Skywalker, has dispatched
thousands of remote probes into
the far reaches of space....


-------------------------VI

Luke Skywalker has returned to
his home planet of Tatooine in
an attempt to rescue his
friend Han Solo from the
clutches of the vile gangster
Jabba the Hutt.

Little does Luke know that the
GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
begun construction on a new
armored space station even
more powerful than the first
dreaded Death Star.

When completed, this ultimate
weapon will spell certain doom
for the small band of rebels
struggling to restore freedom
to the galaxy...

----------------------------VII

Luke Skywalker has vanished.
In his absence, the sinister
FIRST ORDER has risen from
the ashes of the Empire
and will not rest until
Skywalker, the last Jedi,
has been destroyed.

With the support of the
REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa
leads a brave RESISTANCE.
She is desperate to find her
brother Luke and gain his
help in restoring peace
and justice to the galaxy.

Leia has sent her most daring
pilot on a secret mission
to Jakku, where an old ally
has discovered a clue to
Luke's whereabouts....




------------------------VIII


The FIRST ORDER reigns.
Having decimated the peaceful
Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke
now deploys the merciless
legions to seize military
control of the galaxy.

Only General Leia Organa's
band of RESISTANCE fighters
stand against the rising
tyranny, certain that Jedi
Master Luke Skywalker will
return and restore a spark of
hope to the fight.

But the Resistance has been
exposed. As the First Order
speeds toward the rebel base,
the brave heroes mount a
desperate escape....



----------CLONEWARS
A galaxy divided. Striking swiftly after the Battle of Geonosis, Count Dooku’s
droid army has seized control of the major hyperspace lines, separating the
Republic from the majority of its clone army. With few clones available, the
Jedi Generals cannot gain a foothold in the Outer Rim, as more and more
planets choose to join Dooku’s Separatists. While the Jedi are occupied
fighting a war, no-one is left to keep the peace. Chaos and crime spread and
the innocent become victims in a lawless galaxy. Crime lord Jabba the Hutt’s
son has been kidnapped by a rival band of pirates. Desperate to save his son,
Jabba puts out a call for help. A call the Jedi are cautious to answer.

forces runaways into a life of crime in exchange for shelter and protection.
On these mean streets, a young man fights for survival, but yearns to fly
among the stars....

It is a time of crisis for the
Rebel Alliance. On Cloud City,
high above the planet Bespin,
Han Solo has been captured
by Darth Vader's Imperial
forces and frozen in carbonite.

As bounty hunter Boba Fett
prepares to deliver the pirate
to Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels
hatch a desperate plan to
save their friend…

--------------P&F
A couple of summers ago in a galaxy far far away...

On the Desert planet of Tatooine
lived two happy young moisture
farmers, who had absolutely
no plans of leaving or getting
involved in any kind of
intergalactic shenanigans.

Unbeknownst to them the Galactic
Empire had recently finished
constructing its ultimate weapon,
the DEATH STAR.

Meanwhile, having learned the
whereabouts of the Death Star's
plans, the rebels send their best
platypus agent to obtain them, in
hopes of finding a weakness.

And none of this is canon, so just relax.

The Droid forces of the evil Separatists gather above the Wookiee planet
Kashyyyk.

The Jedi Knights have been dispatched to stop the invasion and re-build peace
in the galaxy.
